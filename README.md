The assignment:  Create a trivia game that includes a countdown timer which has multiple choice questions and limit the user to one selection.  When the timer is complete or the user submits their answers, score the user and display a response with the number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions.

The solution:  Created an array of objects to hold the questions and answers.  Used a for loop to loop over the questions/choices to display to the player.  Used another for loop and if statements to take in the player responses and score the player.
